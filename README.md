### Final Project: Target Practice
The target practice game will flash multiple square targets one-by-one at random locations on the screen and the player will attempt to move the mouse and click the targets as fast as possible. There will be a set number of targets each game, and the speed at which each target is flashed will be set by a potentiometer before the game starts. As targets are clicked, a counter on the screen will increment and the average reaction speed will be displayed. Start and reset functionalities will be implemented with two buttons on the physical board. 

Requirements:
1) XADC - potentiometer speed control
2) PS2 mouse - player cursor movement and clicking
3) Moving sprite - flashing targets
4) On-screen display text - targets clicked, average reaction speed
