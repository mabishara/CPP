# Advanced Digital Design VHDL and C++ Projects

This repository contains a collection of various projects done in my advanced VHDL class integrated with C++ aspects.
**Note: the video links contained in the readme.md files no longer work as they expired after a set period, but the code is there to view and download.**

- Primary coding languages include SystemVerilog, VHDL and C++.
- All files have been recently organized into this repository, hence the recent commits.

\*_Projects within this repository were a team collaboration with my partner Kyle Hanano._
